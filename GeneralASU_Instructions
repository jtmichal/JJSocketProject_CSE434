Below are the tool bundles for coding on ASUâ€™s remote Linux server.

Your OS	Command Line	File Transfer	Text Editor
Windows	PuTTY	WinSCP	VS Code / Sublime Text
MacOS	Terminal / iTerm	Cyberduck	VS Code / Sublime Text
Linux (Hardcore)	Terminal	scp	vi / emacs
Additional notes
Hostname is general.asu.edu . Username/passowrd is the same with your ASU username/password. ssh yourasuusername@general.asu.edu

Choose SFTP as the connection protocol on WinSCP/Cyberduck.

In the preferences of WinSCP/Cyberduck, you may select your favorite text editor as default to open *.* files. By doing so, you now can edit and synchronize your code files while working on them locally.

Never forget to refer to gcc/make Tutorial / Makefile Tutorial if you struggle with compiling.

Or email me if you have any more concerns.
